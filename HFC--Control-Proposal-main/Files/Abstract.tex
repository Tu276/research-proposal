The operation of a hydrogen fuel cell requires the control of factors that affect the safety performance, efficiency and lifespan of the proton exchange membrane. This proposal  looks into different control strategies that will be employed for variable power delivery from the hydrogen fuel cell with consideration of safety, efficiency and longevity of operation.
The project will go into modeling of the control system and simulation of different operating conditions to determine the best controllers along with the control parameters. The project will also look into control strategies such as neural networks, linear quadratic regulator and PID control to optimize on factors such as performance and efficiency. Each of the control strategies will be modeled and tested to select the best performing controller which will be developed for the hydrogen fuel cell stack.

\paragraph{\textbf{Keywords:}} efficiency, control strategies, control parameters, performance.
